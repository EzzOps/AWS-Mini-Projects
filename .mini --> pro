My thoughts to advanced this projects by adding more requirments

1- recreate the cloudformation yml file to write the same but with AWS cli script, python script, terraform
2- in this project I update the app files in the manually, how could i do this job in the CI/CD practice?
update = download the files from s3m edit the files, delete the old files from s3, upload the new files

3- is there a serverless app? so why i didn't use lambda
